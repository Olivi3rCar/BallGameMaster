the hardest difficulty was to get the formulas right
By choice, I decided not to include acceleration variables, but only keep speed and positions
after finding our classic equations :
-x = v0 * cos(angle)*t + x0
-y = -0.5*g*t**2 + v0*sin(angle)*t + y0
The biggest problem by far was that the origin (0,0) is situated at the left top corner of the screen, thus
throwing out the window our formula for y
luckily, after some research, this problem can be fixed by multiplying by -1 our formula
(in our movement function, we use the formula of vx and vy as we also alter those with gravity and function)
As for gravity and frictions, we set basic conditions that influence vx and vy:
-Is the ball in air
-Is the ball on the ground and does it move?
